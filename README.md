# Microservices: Use of REST and gRPC over SOAP

Abstract:
Since the induction of Web Services into modern applications, their usage has grown. Together with them the general public was first introduced to the use of protocols like the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Representational State Transfer (REST).

In more recent years a new trend started emerging in the development of applications, in which the application is split into a set of small services that use a communication protocol to interact with another. This trend is known as the Microservice Architecture and it favors the use of REST, a Message Bus or other stateless communication protocols over SOAP.

This paper gives an overview of the Microservice Architecture, explains why the use of REST is favored over SOAP and how the new gRPC Remote Procedure Calls (gRPC) framework may support them.
